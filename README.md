# lic-environment
A collaboration with @n1chey to create a self-governing drone system. The main idea and goal is to decrease level of pollution and fires in the world. An artificial intelligent (which was created by ourselves and included in the code) will scan the given area by drone's camera and detect an oil leak or wood fire and immediately call emergency number to prevent it, while the photos will also be saved in database for future training of intelligence.
